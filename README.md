# Semestral-Project
PID controller written in Python and ROS for stabilization of Parrot Bebop 2 drone is given in this repository. The drone reads data on his current position relative to the center of the arena (ArUco marker). Regardless of his position and orientation it will correct itself above the center of the arena so it can send a signal to Sphero robots to start the task. PID controller values are obtained from the linearized model in Simulink.

# Subheader

This was a team project done in coordinance with 10 people with three sub - teams. One being the quadrotor control team.
